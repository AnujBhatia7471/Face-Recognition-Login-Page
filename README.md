**Face Recognition Login Page**
A browser-based face recognition authentication system built using Python, Flask, OpenCV, and ArcFace (ONNX).
The application allows users to register and log in using their face via a webcam, removing reliance on traditional password-only authentication.
This project demonstrates a real-world ML deployment workflow, combining computer vision, deep learning inference, backend APIs, and frontend camera integration.

**🚀 Key Features**
Browser-based face registration and login
No terminal or CLI interaction for users
High-accuracy ArcFace ONNX model for facial embeddings
Cosine similarity–based face matching
OpenCV DNN–based face detection
Secure storage of facial embeddings (not images)
SQLite database for persistence
Flask REST API backend
Automatic ONNX model download at runtime
Clean and responsive frontend UI
Separation of frontend and backend (deployment-ready)

**🛠 Technology Stack**
**Backend**
Python 3.10
Flask
Flask-CORS
OpenCV (headless)
ONNX Runtime
ArcFace (ONNX)
NumPy
SQLite
**Frontend**
HTML
CSS
JavaScript (Webcam + Fetch API)

**Note:**
The ArcFace ONNX model is not stored in GitHub. It is automatically downloaded at runtime.

**⚙️ Installation (Local Setup)**
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AnujBhatia7471/Face-Recognition-Login-Page.git
cd Face-Recognition-Login/Backend
2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Run the backend
python app.py

Backend runs at:
http://127.0.0.1:5000 ,
5️⃣ Run the frontend
cd ../Frontend
python -m http.server 5500
Open in browser:
http://127.0.0.1:5500

**🔄 Application Workflow**
🔹 Face Registration
User enters an email,
Webcam is activated in the browser,
Multiple face samples are captured,
ArcFace generates facial embeddings,
Embeddings are stored securely in the database

**🔹 Face Login**
User enters registered email,
Webcam captures a live face image,
ArcFace generates a new embedding,
Cosine similarity is computed,
Login is approved only if similarity exceeds a safe threshold

**🔐 Security Considerations**
Facial embeddings are stored — not raw images,
No face images are saved on disk,
Strict similarity threshold to prevent false matches,
Single-face detection enforced per frame,
Designed for educational and demonstration purposes

**📌 Notes & Limitations**
Camera permission must be enabled in the browser,
Best performance under good lighting conditions,
Webcam access requires:
http://localhost (local),
HTTPS (production deployment),
Multiple faces in a single frame are not supported,
Liveness detection (anti-spoofing) is not included

**🌍 Deployment**
This project is deployment-ready using a split architecture:
Backend (ML + API): Railway / Fly.io / Cloud VM,
Frontend (static): Netlify / Vercel,
⚠️ HTTPS is mandatory in production for browser camera access.

**📄 License**
This project is intended for educational and learning purposes only.
Not recommended for production authentication without additional security layers.
